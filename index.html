      Jon Snow is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of
      fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television
      adaptation Game of Thrones, in which he is portrayed by English actor Kit
      Harington.<br />
      He is one of the most popular characters in the series, and The New York
      Times cites him as one of the author's finest creations.
    </p>
    <p class="main-info">
      Jon is described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long
      face, dark brown hair and dark grey eyes.<br />
      Jon has the surname "Snow" (customarily used for illegitimate noble
      children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views
      him as a constant reminder of Ned's infidelity.
